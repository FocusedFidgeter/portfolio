Performed this analysis for multiple 'problem children' clients.\n\nAdded FileIO functionality to our invoicing software. This parsed, edited, and reformatted PDFs and CSV accounting for the many discrepencies between our contracts and technical needs. This allowed us to reduce mutiple clients' processing time by 12-16 hours per week (*30% - 40% of 40h/w*).",

After collecting this data, I created an Excel spreadsheet to forecast the staffing needs (*15 minutes*) and alert the manager to both high and low throughput.",
